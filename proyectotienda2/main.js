      'Introducing Mermaids! inspired by my participation in the Mermay challenge this year. I have created a collection of unique mermaids, each with its own enchanting charm. These mermaids can be placed on the frame of a door, window, switch, shelf, or any other special spot in your home, adding a touch of magic to your surroundings.Every mermaid is meticulously hand-cut and painted, ensuring that each one is truly one-of-a-kind. I use reclaimed wood panels that may have minor imperfections, which are barely noticeable as I ensure they are kept on the back, they add character and tell the story of each mermaid. The mermaids are beautifully painted with acrylic paint and protected with a thin layer of varnish.',
